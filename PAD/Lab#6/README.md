##  Building a Proxy with Shared Databases.

Build a Proxy that will link the client with the main server and assure the integrity of data among servers.

Develop a system of distributed heterogeneous data, centralized in one node type warehousing.

## Small Description

The most important function of the Proxy is to receive GET request from client, and to pass this requests to the server part. Then it receives the response from main server and sends it back to the client. At this level it is also implemented caching of the request

## Conclusion

After implementing this laboratory work, I learn how to build a Proxy that will allow client to communicate with different main Servers, and to receive response from them. I implemented a caching system that will optimize the requests received and send the response faster without accessing the server
